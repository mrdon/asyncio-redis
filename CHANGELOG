CHANGELOG
=========

0.14.2: 2015-12-16
------------------

Fixes:
- Added a few missing @asyncio.coroutine decorators for Python 3.5
  compatibility.


0.14.1: 2015-08-08
------------------

Fixes:
- Correctly handle empty chunks returned by the 'scan' function.
- Correctly handle returned  values in `spop`.
- Fixed default '*' argument for scan operations. (When BytesEncore is used.)

New features:
- Add a RedisProtocol.watch() method
- Added LIMIT support for ZRangeByScore
- Added count parameter to 'scan' cursors.


0.13.4: 2014-08-18
------------------

Fixes:
- Rpoplpush can return nil when the list is empty.


0.13.3: 2014-07-13
------------------

Fixes:
- Protocol was in a faulty state after a transaction failure.
- Pubsub did not work with BytesEncoder.


0.13.2: 2014-07-06
------------------

Fixes:
- Fixed broken psubscribe.


0.13.1: 2014-06-29
------------------

Fixes:
- HiRedisProtocol implementation has been improved. (Cleaner code and a little
  faster.)

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Some arguments of Connection, Pool and RedisProtocol are now keyword-only.
- Made hiredis on optional dependency. (Using extra_required in the setup.)


0.12.6: 2014-06-17
------------------

New features:
- Added `protocol_class` parameter for Pool and Connection
- Added experimental `HiRedisProtocol` class.

Fixes:
- Improving the performance of multibulk replies (Especially _asset, _asdict
  and _aslist methods should be significantly faster.)


0.12.5: 2014-06-03
------------------

Fixes:
- Circular reference between `Connection` and `Protocol` was never cleaned up
  because of __del__.
- Memory leaks in unit tests were fixed.

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Connection is not closed anymore in __del__, like in version 0.12.4, but
  instead the `Connection` and `Pool` classes got an explicit close method.


0.12.4: 2014-05-28
------------------

New features:
- Unix socket support. (When port=3, we suppose unix socket connection.)

Fixes:
- Closing of transport in Connection.__del__ and unittests.


0.12.3: 2014-04-18
------------------

Fixes:
- Correctly handle CancelledError.
- Passing of both host and port variables in unit tests.
- Using the correct loop during reconnect in Connection.


0.12.2: 2014-04-09
------------------

Fixes:
- Passing a custom loop should now work everywhere. (Unit tests added.)


0.12.1: 2014-04-03
------------------

New features:
- _asdict suffixes for methods that have a ZRangeReply return-annotation.
- Added ZREVRANGE

Fixes:
- Encoding of negative integers
- Fixes in the MOVE and PUNSUBSCRIBE
- Using separate logger
- Fix when transmitting large replies over the network.

Backward-incompatibilities:
- Iterating through a DictReply or ZRangeReply now yields futures that return
  (key, value) tuples instead of {key:value} dicts of one element. (This
  behaviour was not really documented and it certainly is an improvement.)

0.11.1: 2014-03-30
------------------

New features:
- Timeout support for blpop/brpop/brpoplpush
- setup.py improved. Don't install asyncio on Python 3.4


0.10.1: 2014-03-19
------------------
No changelog before this point.
